An interface addition for Widgets to let you increase the number of your Sidebars without lose your mind.

== Description ==

When you use Wordpress as a CMS, it's very common to create so many sidebars that when you try to manipulate each one on the Widgets page, you get totally crazy trying to drag and drop the widgets to the right sidebar. Because of this problem I did the Many Sidebars plugin that simply organize all your sidebars and let you work on each one solely.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `many-sidebars` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Widgets page to enjoy

== Screenshots ==

1. In the select field you can find all your sidebars.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.1 =
* Bugfix when open the sidebar panel and drag widgets to it

= 1.0 =
* First release.
